# `EntityAnno`
Utility tools for generating [`Mindustry`](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry)
custom entity component classes. Offered features:
- Nearly one-to-one integration of the entity component class generator in Mindustry,
  with an additional utility to properly register the entity class IDs for usage in
  `UnitType`s and persistence across save files.
- Java 9+ syntax availability in Java 8, which is necessary for Mindustry mods.
- Supports both release and bleeding-edge Mindustry version hashes.
- A [comprehensive guide](/USAGE.md).
- A [dedicated template](https://github.com/GlennFolker/MindustryModTemplate).
